1/24/2020 Notes

Goal is to transform any positive integer (# of seconds) into the translated time stamp (min, hr, day, wk, mnth, etc.)

MINUTES
141 --> 2m, 21s
    How to get the 2 in 2m --> 141/60/60 --> long division, esentially

    How to get the 21s --> 60seconds = 1min; 60s*2(from the 2min)=120; 141-120= 21 leftover seconds

697 --> 11m, 37s
    11--> 60*11=660
    37--> 697-660= 37s

**possible to use the % operator at any point?
    divide number by 60 until % = a number from 1 to 59; the remainder becomes seconds
        but how would this work for converting into days, weeks, etc?

HOURS
**possible to use the % operator at any point?
    divide number by 60 until % = a number from 1 to 59; the remainder becomes min---> anytime it runs through a loop, there's a counter
       runs through the minute function next...continutes until % is a # 1 to 59
        remainder becomes seconds

DAYS
24hrs=1 day
divide number by 24 until % = a number between 0 and 24

******REALIZATION 1 @1:40pm: I actually don't think this will work now because te numbers are huge amounts of seconds and need to be broken down
in reverse order I think? Like you go from seconds to minutes to hours etc...

******REALIZATION 2 @1:42pm: ACTUALLY IT WILL WORK I WAS JUST CONFUSING NUMBERS IN MY HEAD WHICH IS WHY I DRAW THINGS OUT INSTEAD OF TYPING FUCK

    divide number by 60 until % = a number from 1 to 59; the remainder becomes min---> anytime it runs through a loop, there's a counter
       runs through the minute function next...continutes until % is a # 1 to 59
        remainder becomes seconds
