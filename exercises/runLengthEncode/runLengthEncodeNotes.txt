RLE Notes

ABCABC --> 1A1B1C1A1B1C
AAAABCCCCABB --> 4A1B4C1A2B

rle(string)--> string

What am I doing:
1. Looking at the first element of the string
2 Begin a count of that element
3. Look at the next element
4a. If the element is the same, add to the
count
4b. If the element is different, begin a new 
count
5. Repeat 

What do I think I Need to Do:
1. definitely need a for loop with a counter
2. I'm not sure how a counter works with a string
    I would feel more comfortable, i think, changing the 
    string into an array, pushing the results into a new
    array, and then changing the array back into a 
    string.
